                        In JavaScript, variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means they are only accessible within the function in which they are declared.
                </li>
                <li>
                        If var is used outside of a function, it becomes globally scoped and is accessible throughout the entire program.
                </li>
                <hr class="mt-5 mb-8  ">
                <li>
                    When you declare a variable using let inside a block (a set of curly braces {}), the variable is only accessible within that block and its nested blocks. It's not accessible outside of that block.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In versions of JavaScript prior to ES6, let doesn't have block scope; instead, it has function scope. This means that a variable declared with let inside a function is only accessible within that function.
                </li>
                <hr class="mt-5 mb-8 ">
                <li>
                    In JavaScript, const is used to declare variables with a constant value within the scope of a block, function, or module. Variables declared with const are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the block where they are defined.

                    Functions can return null to indicate that no meaningful result or data is available.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can assign null to a variable to indicate that it hasn't been assigned any meaningful value yet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can set a variable to null to clear its value or release memory resources when you no longer need the data stored in it.

                <hr class="mt-5 mb-8 ">

                <li>
                    You can use undefined to check if a function parameter was omitted or not passed when defining default values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Variables that are declared but not initialized have a value of undefined. You can use this to check if a variable has been assigned a value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can create an array with undefined values as placeholders, which can be useful when you plan to fill the array with values later.

                Meaning And Principles  Of REST API
            </h2>
            <div class="list-disc text-lg">
                <li>
                    REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a set of architectural principles and constraints for designing networked applications. REST is not a protocol but rather a style of building web services.
                </li>
                <hr class="mt-5 mb-8 ">
                <li>
                    Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not rely on any stored context from previous requests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Client-Server Architecture: The client and server should be separate entities that can evolve independently. This separation allows for scalability and simplifies the architecture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resource-Based: Resources, such as data objects or services, are identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). Clients interact with these resources using standard HTTP methods like GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), and DELETE (remove).
                </li>
